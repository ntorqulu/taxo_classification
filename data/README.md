# Database

The database was obtained initially from the [NJORDR](https://github.com/adriantich/NJORDR-MJOLNIR3) repo which attempted to create a database for the COI barcode using the [mkCOInr](https://github.com/meglecz/mkCOInr) repo.
The initial files can be downloaded from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NbJ90I6jyYmkxZyJvI70vmsjzPalVbEL?usp=drive_link).

To create the final database the Pipeline4FinalDataset.py script was used.
The classes for each level were defined after inspecting the original data (see overview)
